							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>My name is Ishita Verma and I'm currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT university. My student number is 's3757453' and my email address is ishitaverma078@gmail.com. Being an Indian and 18 years in age, I've completed my secondary education from India in year 2018. I'm a Hindu, so I can fluently speak Hindi as well as English.<br>Talking about my interests and hobbies,initially, I love gymming! Gym is like a rejuvination house for me. I am also a great fan of Badminton. Not everyone knows that i was a badminton player in my school. Apart from these, I have a pet dog whom I love the most and his name is Leo. </p>

							<h2>Interests in IT</h2>
							<p>Computers have always amused me. I am quite interested in learning computer languages and coding them to create a software or for other uses in security field. I developed my interest in coding during the last few years of my secondary education, watching my elder brother make games and talk about how he uses coding for analysing and implementing business strategies for the company he worked. I was very keen about the topic, therefore I used to carry out some researches, after which, today at present, I am quite thrilled about the ideas and opportunities that learning coding will provide me.<br><br> For pusuing my interests in computer programming, I needed an institute which can inbuilt the proper practical skills required in the real world.The university is highly reagrded and ranked in study and student employment satisfaction rate.Unlike most of the institutes that focus on theoretical ,and sometimes, useless concepts, RMIT university is the one that makes it's students trained in what the world needs. IT is a subject of practicality, which means implying your ideas and skills so as to see what change can it make in the real world. RMIT, not only makes student independent in expressing and applying their thoughts, but also provides them some industry experience for working further. Overall, RMIT focuses in digging the skills deep into the minds of it's students rather than creating a deceptive layer of cramming.<br><br>For such a highly recognised university, I expect to develop all the essential skills required for entering the workforce or working independently. I expect to grab as many computer languages under my belt as I can along with deep understanding of computers' world for implementing my learned skills in any field I desire.     </p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p>Aiming to start my own business one day, my ideal job would be somewhere around business handling. For gaining experience in the business industry, working as a business analyst has everything that I desire for in a job.The fact that they strategize technology in a way that it benefits the company, makes it more appealing to me.This position will not only let me experiment with my software development and data analysing skills, but will also instill leadership quality and a great business sense.<br>Moving on to applying for such a job in future, it requires various skills in the field of Information Technology.Initially, it demands a tertiary degree in IT along with some previous experience in analysis and software development.Apart from skills in IT such as software development, analytics, database management,etc., it also requires high interpersonal and communication skills. Furthermore, time management and multiple task management skills are also crucial.Updating and figuring out the right technology for the right purpose is an essential aspect of undertaking such a job.In short, everything involved in multiplying the sales of the company will be undertaken by the business analyst.<br>As currently I'm studying Bachelor of IT in RMIT, I donot have any previous experience or skills in the subject except for working efficiently in Microsoft Word and Excel.I came to RMIT straight after my high school,where I mainly studied three subjects- Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. So, for grabbing all the skills required to get into the IT workforce, I'm here in RMIT, pursuing my degree in IT.<br>With the skills and qualification that I have now, I'll not be able to apply for my ideal job because I need to accomplish something before getting into such a job.Therefore, in addition to studying at RMIT, I will try to gain some experience in software development and analytics by working on paid or unpaid internships in companies that require minimal or no experience but just the knowledge on how to implement the skills during my breaks.Also, RMIT gives it's students an opportunity to select major stream of study along with some minor coureses. In that case, i will be opting for software development and software testing along with organisational analysis, logistics and management that will help giving me a further overview on how my ideal job would be handled appropriately. After the completion of my course, I will aim to be working as a professional in the field of IT to gain experience of around 3-4 years along with doing some independent researchs and experiments to enhance my skills.After all these years of studying and working as an IT professional in a certain company,wherein I would also have to polish on my leadership qualities, I will be eligible to acheive my ideal job.<p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>To know more about me, have a look at the results of different tests I've given.These are : Myers-Briggs test,Learning style test and Big Five Personality test.These tests are the result of what I think I am and I find these tests to be giving a hint of my personality because I was the one to answer all the questions.But I also think that answers to these questions could always be changing according to the situation and time as nobody could ever have a fixed opinion about himself everytime. Moreover, if we are just agreeing to do a certain thing,sometimes, doesn't mean we'll actually be doing it when the situation persists.Overall, just by answering few questions, we cannot be 100% accurate.<br>   .</p>
