							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>My name is Ishita Verma and I'm currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT university. My student number is 's3757453' and my email address is ishitaverma078@gmail.com. Being an Indian and 18 years in age, I've completed my secondary education from India in year 2018. I'm a Hindu, so I can fluently speak Hindi as well as English.<br>Talking about my interests and hobbies,initially, I love gymming! Gym is like a rejuvination house for me. I am also a great fan of Badminton. Not everyone knows that i was a badminton player in my school. Apart from these, I have a pet dog whom I love the most and his name is Leo. </p>

							<h2>Interests in IT</h2>
							<p>Computers have always amused me. I am quite interested in learning computer languages and coding them to create a software or for other uses in security field. I developed my interest in coding during the last few years of my secondary education, watching my elder brother make games and talk about how he uses coding for analysing and implementing business strategies for the company he worked. I was very keen about the topic, therefore I used to carry out some researches, after which, today at present, I am quite thrilled about the ideas and opportunities that learning coding will provide me.<br><br> For pusuing my interests in computer programming, I needed an institute which can inbuilt the proper practical skills required in the real world.The university is highly reagrded and ranked in study and student employment satisfaction rate.Unlike most of the institutes that focus on theoretical ,and sometimes, useless concepts, RMIT university is the one that makes it's students trained in what the world needs. IT is a subject of practicality, which means implying your ideas and skills so as to see what change can it make in the real world. RMIT, not only makes student independent in expressing and applying their thoughts, but also provides them some industry experience for working further. Overall, RMIT focuses in digging the skills deep into the minds of it's students rather than creating a deceptive layer of cramming.<br><br>For such a highly recognised university, I expect to develop all the essential skills required for entering the workforce or working independently. I expect to grab as many computer languages under my belt as I can along with deep understanding of computers' world for implementing my learned skills in any field I desire.     </p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							
							<p>The link to the advertisement of my ideal job is <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38688707?searchrequesttoken=d96c75e7-4407-400d-acf2-d0511cadf6c3&type=standout">here </a>. Aiming to start my own business one day, my ideal job would be somewhere around business handling. For gaining experience in the business industry, working as a business analyst has everything that I desire for in a job.The fact that they strategize technology in a way that it benefits the company, makes it more appealing to me.This position will not only let me experiment with my software development and data analysing skills, but will also instill leadership quality and a great business sense.<br>Moving on to applying for such a job in future, it requires various skills in the field of Information Technology.Initially, it demands a tertiary degree in IT along with some previous experience in analysis and software development.Apart from skills in IT such as software development, analytics, database management,etc., it also requires high interpersonal and communication skills. Furthermore, time management and multiple task management skills are also crucial.Updating and figuring out the right technology for the right purpose is an essential aspect of undertaking such a job.In short, everything involved in multiplying the sales of the company will be undertaken by the business analyst.<br>As currently I'm studying Bachelor of IT in RMIT, I donot have any previous experience or skills in the subject except for working efficiently in Microsoft Word and Excel.I came to RMIT straight after my high school,where I mainly studied three subjects- Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. So, for grabbing all the skills required to get into the IT workforce, I'm here in RMIT, pursuing my degree in IT.<br>With the skills and qualification that I have now, I'll not be able to apply for my ideal job because I need to accomplish something before getting into such a job.Therefore, in addition to studying at RMIT, I will try to gain some experience in software development and analytics by working on paid or unpaid internships in companies that require minimal or no experience but just the knowledge on how to implement the skills during my breaks.Also, RMIT gives it's students an opportunity to select major stream of study along with some minor coureses. In that case, i will be opting for software development and software testing along with organisational analysis, logistics and management that will help giving me a further overview on how my ideal job would be handled appropriately. After the completion of my course, I will aim to be working as a professional in the field of IT to gain experience of around 3-4 years along with doing some independent researchs and experiments to enhance my skills.After all these years of studying and working as an IT professional in a certain company,wherein I would also have to polish on my leadership qualities, I will be eligible to acheive my ideal job.<p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>To know more about me, have a look at the results of different tests I've given.These are : Myers-Briggs test,Learning style test and Big Five Personality test.These tests are the result of what I think I am and I find these tests to be giving a hint of my personality because I was the one to answer all the questions.But I also think that answers to these questions could always be changing according to the situation and time as nobody could ever have a fixed opinion about himself everytime. Moreover, if we are just agreeing to do a certain thing,sometimes, doesn't mean we'll actually be doing it when the situation persists.Overall, just by answering few questions, a website couldn't be 100% accurate about us.<br><br>According to me, as the tests indicate what kind of a person I am to some extent, I do know what qualities and drawbacks I have in my personality. So, in order to be working efficiently in a team, I'll be improving on the qualities where I am lagging behind. According to one of the tests, I have a EITJA personality type, which means that I am extravert, intuitive, thoughtful, judjing and assertive. This makes me highly competitive, which is good because a sense of healthy competition brings out the best in us . Acoording to the other personality test, I am also highly conscious and imaginative which would bring a proper balance of practicality and experimentation in my actions. In my thoughts I'll be able to work perfectly fine in a team because I have almost all the traits to be able to work in a team.<br><br>When forming a team, based on my personality, I would want to work with people who are quite similar to me. I would want them to have their opinion along with some assertiveness because I would be able to perform well in an environment of individuality and healthy competitiveness. But to be able to work together as a team, the members should also have some amount of agreeableness as well as a sense of appreciation for others efforts. So. I will be taking this factor into account and focus on giving my best for the team. Finally, it's really important sometimes to forget about our own benefit and focus on what the team needs because afterall proper teamwork will lead us to the goal.    </p>

							<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
							<p>Here is a project that I would love to work on by applying my skills and knowledge and being able to do as much as possible..</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>

									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p> I am very passionate about fitness and living a healthy lifestyle. But watching obesity grow at such an alarming rate around the world makes me feel worried. Being a fitness lover, I feel like taking initiative towards this issue of obesity. I want to make people realize the importance of their health and exercise. So, in order to do so, I wish to create my own fitness app for reaching out to people. I am aware of the fact that there are tons of fitness apps already available in the market but what I want to build is not just a random, easy-going app. I want to add everything that an individual requires in his or her journey of becoming fit because it's not just about gymming, there are other factors to add too.Eating right and feeling good about what you are doing also plays a vital role towards staying fit and healthy. This would not only reduce the risk of several diseases scientifically but also reduce the amount of stress and uncomfortability psychologically that one has about his or her body being obese. My project will be a fitness app that will not only take care of the exercising and diet needs but will also take into account the support and motivation a person needs during the course.

</p>

									<span class="icon style2 major fa-bar-chart"></span>
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p> According to a survey, 30% of the world's total population is suffering from obesity which is predicted to rise over the course of years. According to an another survey, 58% of smartphone users have downloaded a fitness app. And among these, about 52 percent of users said they downloaded health apps to track physical activity, while 47 percent wanted to track what they ate. Forty-six percent said they downloaded health apps to lose weight and 34 percent said they wanted to use health apps to learn exercises.This clearly shows that people need different apps for different purposes. But I want to combine everything catering to the needs of the people in just one app. Now, with the use of this app, people won't have to switch to separate apps for separate things. This will reduce hassle which, a lot of times, people want to avoid and eventually donot want to commit to the apps. Moreover this will be a free app available to every smartphone user which will grab more amount of customers in the long run as easy feasibility and affordability are the first criteria that needs to be resolved.There aren't much apps that offer everything in free which will be where this project would be different and interesting.

									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>
As I already mentioned that I aim to create a whole package in just one app, it will provide the following features: exercising schedule or timetable, diet charts along with the calorie counts of all the included foods, fitness trackers and some motivation needed throughout. Beginning with the exercises, this app will contain different types of exercising plans based on your goals. For example, if a person wants to lose fat, then there will be a separate exercise plan for the fat loss. These different types of plans will contain videos to demonstrate the correct posture for a given exercise.These videos would contain some workout videos of professional bodybuilders. The videos n will be suggesting the sets and repetitions required to do along with amount of calories burnt if followed the plan. In order to keep bringing in some variations within the workout, there will be exercises grouped according to a particular body part to give the customers independency to be able to chose the exercise themselves. Apart from this, each exercise type will elaborate what muscle group it targets along with it's benefits. Moving on to the diet part, this is the main step towards acheiving desired goals. There will be diet plans based again on the goals of an individual along with the calorie counts. The diet plan will undertake every meal including the cheat meals. If a person wants some variations in the diet, then there will be another section of all of the healthy foods. To make this dieting part much easier and at convinience, the meals that will be mentioned in the diet plans will also have recepies of how to prepare them. This will not only save the time of the customer as he or she won't have to look out out for a recipe somewhere else but will also provide them a sense of surity as to what they are cooking is actually what's mentioned. If a person is further interested beyond the natural diet, this app will also provide them a recommendations about health supplements like protein powders, pre-workouts,BCAA's , etc. There will be two different sections of vegetarians and non-vegetarians for the ease of cutomers. Now for the tracking part, the app will be able to track the progress of a person depending on the plan chosen. Other than the gym exercises, it will also be able to track any other physical activity such as running, walking or swimming and give out the calories burnt as a result.It will include the calories required to intake in a day and amount of water needed per day. Coming onto the extras for this app, it will include some motivational quotes as well as motivational videos. These motivational videos could be the stories of some famous people who have acheived what they once desired for. These videos will create a lesser degree of people dropping out of the plan due to lack of motivation. This will help people stay on track until they acheive their goals.

									<h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
									<p>For making an app, I would require java in eclipse to code down the app along with java development kit which will create an environment for the language or i could use brackets for HTML5 coding. Eclipse is a platform for writing all the codes of the game and then compiling it so as to run the code. For the app to run, various hardwares have also to be used such as accelerometers, gyroscopes,compases and GPS. A gyroscope is a device that uses Earth’s gravity to help determine the orientation of an object in space; a compass determines cardinal direction, and an accelerometer is designed to measure acceleration.Motion trackers are used to measure walking, running, cycling and swimming activities. With the data collected, smartwatches and apps can calculate speed, cadence, distance traveled, and number of calories burnt.The global positioning system receiver is a valuable feature for runners, cyclists, and hikers.GPS uses 30-some satellites orbiting the Earth to make it possible for users to map their routes, know their exact position, and measure movement speed. These will my requirements for the app.

									<h3>Skills Required</h3>
									<p>Making an app is not an easy task especially when it comes to creating a multitasking app. For this, I would need to learn computer programming completely. I would need java and will be working in eclipse workspace so as to create an app for the android system. For an IOS, use of Multi-OS engine will be required.This is an open source technology that allows to create android and IOS apps in Java.This technology provides a stand-alone plug-in that integrates into Android Studio on Windows and/or Apple macOS development machines.Further, for programming in HTML5, I will require to learn this language as well. Along with programming, designing and data managing skills will also help a lot for this app because a proper organisation of things is what attracts more public. Software testing skills will aslo be put in use. The hardwares such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses are already stacked in the smartphones. With the help of all these skills, I'll be able to build an app for both IOS and android users. Feasibility of the hardwares and softwares will not be an issue because they will be easily avaialable but the skills will require some amount of time to roll in.

									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>If the project is successful, my app could be one of the most used apps in the world and the fact that everything here wouldn't be chargeable will add to it's popularity. People wouldn't have to rely on distinct apps for distinct purposes. Also, they wouldn't have to rely on personal trainers or nutritionists and spend their hard-earned money on them.Obesity, being the original problem, will decrease to some extent because this app will organise people on a healthy diet and exercise along with having treats or cheat meals at certain occasions.Obesity basically comes through unorganised and over eating which will not persist anymore after the introduction of this app. This will eventually decrease the amount of diseases caused by obesity leading further to less deaths due to obesity.This app is for making people aware of their health and every person deserves to be having all the knowledge about staying fit without having to pay much for it. </p>
